# Movieflex_iOS

## Motivation

Based on the requests that I got in my Instagram account - [**@shubham_iosdev**](https://www.instagram.com/shubham_iosdev/).
I decided to create a UIKit based iOS app with MVVM architecture with hopes that it'll help out other iOS developers to learn MVVM as well as how to maintain a clean and simple architecture.



## Languages / Frameworks Used
* Swift 5
* UIKit
The project is built supporting iOS 13.6, you can change the deployment target to run it on previous iOS versions.

## How to run the project ?
* Download the zip file or clone the project, currently there's one master branch.
* Run the project using Xcode( change the bundle identifier, if you want to run it on your device).


## Having trouble ?
* If you are having trouble with this project or if you find any bugs, do open a new issue and describe the problem.
* Alternatively, you can drop me a mail @ shubham_iosdev@outlook.com.
